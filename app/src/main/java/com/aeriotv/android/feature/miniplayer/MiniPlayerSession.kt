/**
 * Process-wide state holder for the mini-player overlay anchored above the
 * bottom nav. Mirrors iOS NowPlayingManager's surfaced channel handle, but
 * scoped down: v1 ships as a tap-to-resume affordance only — no in-row
 * live video render, no audio continuation across the boundary. The user
 * still sees what they were last watching and can re-enter the player
 * with one tap.
 *
 * State machine:
 *   Hidden  ◀──────────── system back from PlayerScreen
 *      │                  (or explicit Close button)
 *      │
 *      ▼  channel tap
 *   Active(channel)  ◀── system back while playing
 *      │
 *      ▼  tap row
 *   Hidden + nav PLAYER(channel)
 *
 * Why a Hilt @Singleton and not a ViewModel: the session has to outlive
 * every screen-scoped ViewModel and survive nav-stack pops. ViewModels
 * scoped to NavBackStackEntry would lose state every time the user exits
 * the player and the back stack collapses.
