/**
 * Process-wide libmpv warm-up. Ports iOS Aerio/App/MPVPlayerView.swift's
 * `MPVLibraryWarmup` (lines 12-235). The whole point is to pay libmpv's
 * one-time initialization cost (codec/protocol/hwdec registration,
 * profile=fast filter chain, mediacodec JNI bridge setup) on a background
 * thread shortly after cold launch, so the user's first channel tap hits
 * the warm path instead of waiting ~1-2 seconds for a fresh
 * `mpv.create()` + `mpv.init()` cycle to complete in the foreground.
 *
 * On iOS this single change is the headline reason channel-tap startup
 * feels "wicked fast" -- without the warmup, the first tap blocks the
 * tap target while libmpv lazily registers everything for the first time;
 * with it, registration is already done and `loadfile` fires immediately
 * on the user-facing MPV handle.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *  - [start] kicks off the warmup on a background dispatcher, after an
 *    800 ms launch grace period (Activity first-paint + DataStore
 *    bootstrap should land inside that window, so the warmup never
 *    competes with the visible cold-launch sequence for the JNI mutex).
 *  - Safe to call from any thread; only the first call does anything.
 *  - [waitUntilComplete] spin-polls with 50 ms sleeps so a caller in
 *    PlayerScreen's AndroidView.factory can synchronize the user-facing
 *    `mpv.create()` to the warmup result. Returns true on success, false
 *    on timeout. After timeout the caller proceeds anyway with the cold
 *    path -- the warmup is an optimization, not a hard requirement.
 *  - Warmup never retries on failure. If `mpv.create` / `mpv.init`
 *    throws on the throwaway handle, the warmup logs and bails;
 *    subsequent real playback hits its own (cold) error path.
