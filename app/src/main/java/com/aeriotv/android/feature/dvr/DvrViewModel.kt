     * recording showed pills.
     *
     * CRITICAL: this is fire-and-forget. The caller has ALREADY pushed the
     * recordings to _state (so the DVR tab + list painted instantly); this
     * launches a separate coroutine that resolves each category and patches it
     * into _state as it lands, so pills appear a moment later WITHOUT blocking
     * the first list render. The previous cut computed categories synchronously
     * before the first _state update, which stalled the DVR tab ~55s.
     *
     * Resolution path: a completed recording carries no category field of its
     * own, but it does surface an EPG programme id (top-level int FK or nested
     * custom_properties.program.id, exposed as Recording.programId). We feed
     * that id to getProgramDetail (`/api/epg/programs/<id>/`), the ONLY REST
     * endpoint that returns `categories` (the bulk list / grid strip them for
     * perf). This is the same endpoint ProgramInfoSheet uses for guide pills.
     * NO unfiltered programme-list fetch: the old `?tvg_id=` walk returned the
     * server's entire ~53k-row programme list (the param didn't filter), which
     * is what made a refresh take ~55s and never matched.
     *
     * Cache discipline ([categoryCache], keyed by recording id):
     *  - A DEFINITIVE result is memoised so the row is fetched at most once:
     *    a resolved genre, OR a confirmed "programme has no category" (cached
     *    as the empty string so we don't re-hit the network for a feed without
     *    `<category>`).
     *  - A FETCH FAILURE is NOT cached, so the next 30s refresh retries.
     *  - Per-programme-id detail fetches are de-duplicated within a single
     *    pass so two recordings of the same programme don't double-fetch.
     * Best-effort and offline-safe: a row with no resolvable programme id, or
