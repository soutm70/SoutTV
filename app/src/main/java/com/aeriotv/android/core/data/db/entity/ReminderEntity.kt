/**
 * One row per scheduled programme reminder. Mirrors iOS `programReminders`
 * @AppStorage map keyed by "channelName|title|startTs" — same composite key
 * lives in [reminderKey] so the Android port preserves uniqueness semantics.
 *
 * The alarm itself is scheduled with AlarmManager at [startMillis] minus a
 * 5-minute pre-roll so users get a heads-up before the programme starts.
 *
 * `playlistId` is the new (DB v9) FK to PlaylistEntity. Cascade-delete on
 * playlist removal so a stale reminder doesn't outlive its source server.
 * Nullable + ON DELETE CASCADE so pre-v9 rows survive with null playlistId.
 * The AlarmManager registration is NOT auto-cancelled by this cascade — the
 * pending intent fires harmlessly with no row to fetch, and the broadcast
 * receiver no-ops on null lookup.
