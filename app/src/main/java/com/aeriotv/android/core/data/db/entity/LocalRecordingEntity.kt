/**
 * One row per local recording file. Populated by [LocalRecordingService] on
 * stream completion (or cancellation). Mirrors iOS Recording (Models.swift:680)
 * but only the local-destination fields — server-side recordings stay on
 * Dispatcharr and are queried fresh via the API.
 *
 * `playlistId` is the new (DB v9) FK to PlaylistEntity. Mirrors iOS commit
 * 2efd777 (2026-05-10) cascade-delete behaviour: removing a playlist drops
 * its local recording rows. The TS file on disk is NOT auto-deleted by this
 * cascade — file cleanup is the responsibility of the user-facing delete
 * action in DvrTabContent. Nullable + ON DELETE CASCADE so pre-v9 rows
 * survive the migration with null playlistId and never trigger an
 * unintended cascade.
