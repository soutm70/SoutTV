/**
 * Disk-cached channel snapshot. Mirrors the same pattern Phase 121 introduced
 * for the EPG (see [EpgProgrammeEntity]): the last successfully-fetched channel
 * list for each playlist is persisted with a [fetchedAt] timestamp so a cold
 * launch can repaint the Live TV rail + guide INSTANTLY from cache while the
 * network refresh runs in the background. Without this, every cold launch
 * stares at an empty rail for ~10-20s waiting on `repository.refresh(saved)` to
 * round-trip the Dispatcharr / M3U fetch + parse (Archie pointed out: with
 * caching working, loading times shouldn't be an issue for relaunches <24h).
 *
 * Rows are scoped by [playlistId] (a [PlaylistEntity.id] UUID string). The
 * cache is a pure derived-data store and can be safely dropped / rebuilt at
 * any time. [position] preserves the channel order produced by [PlaylistRepository.fetchChannelsFor]
 * (Dispatcharr: channelNumber asc then name; M3U: file order) so the rail
 * paints in the same order the live fetch would. We deliberately do NOT cache
 * `M3UChannel.rawAttributes` because nothing reads it after parsing.
