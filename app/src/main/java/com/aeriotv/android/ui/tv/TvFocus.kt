/**
 * tvOS-style focus grow.
 *
 * Apple TV grows the focused element with a quick, slightly springy scale (and
 * lifts it above its neighbours). Android TV focusables in this app previously
 * only swapped a border/background colour the instant focus landed, which is
 * exactly the "rigid vs the smoothness of the tvOS app" feel Archie called out.
 *
 * Drop [tvFocusScale] into a focusable's modifier chain BEFORE the
 * clip/background/border so the whole card scales as one unit, e.g.
 *
 * ```
 * Modifier
 *     .onFocusChanged { focused = it.isFocused }
 *     .tvFocusScale(focused)
 *     .clip(shape)
 *     .background(bg)
 *     .border(...)
 *     .focusable()
 * ```
 *
 * Keyed on [focused], which is only ever true under D-pad focus, so this is a
 * no-op on touch devices (their elements never gain focus) and is safe to apply
 * unconditionally without an `isTv` guard.
 *
 * The [zIndex] bump means the focused, scaled element draws on top of its
 * siblings (so a grown poster/cell/pill is never clipped by the next item),
 * matching how the tvOS focus engine lifts the focused view.

 * does not reliably hand UP/DOWN back to the focus system on a leanback
 * remote, so the user gets stuck on the slider with no way down.

 * way DOWN the tree -- before the Slider's own key handling -- so we can
 * intercept UP/DOWN, explicitly move focus, and consume them, while
