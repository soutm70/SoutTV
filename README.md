# AerioTV for Android

AerioTV for Android is a native IPTV streaming app for Android phones, tablets, and Google TV / Android TV, built from a single Jetpack Compose codebase. It connects to Dispatcharr (admin login or API key), Xtream Codes, and M3U playlist servers to deliver live TV, movies, and series with a full electronic program guide (EPG) when supplied by the user.

It is the Android port of [AerioTV for Apple platforms](https://github.com/jonzey231/AerioTV).

**Google Play**
- AerioTV is in closed testing on Google Play (invite only).

**Sideload**
- Download the latest `.apk` from [Releases](https://github.com/jonzey231/AerioTV-Android/releases) and install it (enable install from unknown sources for your browser or file manager, or run `adb install`). The sideload build is occasionally ahead of the Play track.

## Supported Server Types

AerioTV connects to three different playlist types. Each unlocks a different set of features. If you are choosing between them, the short version is below.

Click each type for the full breakdown:

<details>
<summary><strong>Dispatcharr Direct Connect</strong> <em>(Recommended)</em> admin username and password, or an API key. <em>Most full-featured option.</em></summary>

[Dispatcharr](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr) is a self-hosted IPTV middleware that gives users control over their IPTV services. See the linked GitHub.

**What Dispatcharr is uniquely good at**

- **Server-side DVR**: schedule recordings that keep running even when AerioTV is closed or the device is asleep. (Local recording to the device works on every server type, but Dispatcharr is the only one where the server itself runs the recording.)
- **Comskip (commercial-skip)**: toggle it when scheduling a server-side recording, or run it after the fact from the DVR tab. Comskip runs on the Dispatcharr server, so it is only available for server-side recordings.
- **Server-side recording playback**: stream completed server recordings directly, no auth headers needed.
- **Server-side stream failover via channel UUID**: when a primary stream dies mid-playback, Dispatcharr swaps to a backup provider transparently.
- **TMDB-enriched VOD metadata**: backdrops, plots, cast, director, year, rating, runtime, plus per-episode air dates, TMDB ratings, IMDB IDs, and per-episode artwork, pulled in by Dispatcharr's TMDB scraper. (Xtream Codes also has VOD, but its metadata is whatever the provider supplies, usually poster, title, and a one-line plot.)
- **Bulk EPG fetch**: one network call returns the grid for every channel via `/api/epg/grid/`. Xtream Codes uses per-stream EPG calls; M3U pulls XMLTV from a separate URL.
- **Per-server custom User-Agent override**: set it in Settings, Edit Playlist. It is sent on Dispatcharr API requests and on playback, so the value shows up in Dispatcharr's admin Stats panel. Not currently exposed for Xtream Codes or M3U.
- **External XMLTV URL override** <em>(advanced)</em>: point the EPG at a third-party XMLTV source while keeping channels from Dispatcharr's API.
- **Auto-discovery of recordings scheduled outside the app**: recordings you scheduled from the Dispatcharr web UI appear in AerioTV's DVR tab within a couple of minutes. Xtream Codes and M3U have no server-side scheduler to discover from.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Xtream Codes</strong> source URL plus username and password. <em>No self-hosting required.</em></summary>

The Xtream Codes API is what most IPTV providers natively expose. You log in with the username and password your provider gave you, and AerioTV pulls live TV, movies, and series.

**Benefits**

- **No self-hosting.** Most IPTV providers expose an Xtream Codes endpoint by default. Paste the URL, type your credentials, done.
- **Live TV plus a VOD library.** Movies and series come from the same login as live channels, with no separate EPG or VOD URLs to manage.
- **Per-playlist VOD toggle.** Settings, Edit Playlist exposes the same "fetch VOD from this playlist" switch Dispatcharr has, so you can keep a secondary playlist's Live TV without loading its VOD library every launch.
- **Local DVR with pre-roll and post-roll.** Recordings on this device, with the same buffer pickers (None / 5 / 10 / 15 / 30 / 60 min or custom) Dispatcharr server-side recordings get. Recordings continue while the app stays running.
- **EPG via TVG ID matching.** Most provider EPGs key to Xtream's `tvg_id` field automatically. You can also point an external XMLTV URL at it.
- **Familiar auth model.** A single username and password.

**Drawbacks**

- **VOD metadata is provider-supplied, not TMDB-enriched.** You typically get the poster, title, and a one-line plot. Per-episode air dates, TMDB ratings, and per-episode artwork are not available.
- **No server-side DVR.** Recordings are local only, so AerioTV has to keep running for the recording duration. No comskip (Dispatcharr only).
- **EPG depth varies by provider.** Some give you a few days, some give you a few hours.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>M3U Playlist</strong> direct URL plus an optional XMLTV EPG. <em>Universal compatibility, simplest setup.</em></summary>

A plain M3U playlist is just a list of stream URLs in a text file. It works with any IPTV provider that gives you a playlist URL, including providers that do not support the Xtream Codes API.

**Benefits**

- **Universal compatibility.** If a provider hands you any URL ending in `.m3u` or `.m3u8`, AerioTV can play it.
- **Fastest setup.** Paste the URL and you are done. No credentials, no server, no scrape time.
- **No self-hosting.**
- **Local DVR with pre-roll and post-roll.** Recordings on this device, with the same buffer pickers Xtream Codes and Dispatcharr recordings get. Recordings continue while the app stays running.
- **Optional separate XMLTV URL** for EPG. Bring your own EPG source if your provider does not include one.

**Drawbacks**

- **No VOD library.** M3U is live TV only, no movies or series. If your provider has VOD, you will need their Xtream Codes endpoint (or a Dispatcharr instance pointed at them) to access it.
- **No server-side DVR.** Recordings are local only, so AerioTV has to be running for the recording to capture. No comskip (Dispatcharr only).
- **EPG depends on a separate XMLTV source.** You set the URL yourself, and EPG quality is whatever that source provides.
- **No stream failover.** When a stream URL stops working, the provider has to fix the playlist. There is no server-side swap like Dispatcharr has.
- **Large M3U files can be slow to parse** on first launch. A playlist with tens of thousands of channels takes a noticeable beat to ingest.

## Tech Stack

- Kotlin 2.3 + Jetpack Compose (Material 3)
- Compose for TV (`androidx.tv`) for Google TV / Android TV form factors
- Media3 / ExoPlayer for playback (HLS, DASH, progressive; hardware decode including HEVC HDR)
- Room (relational data) + DataStore (preferences)
- Ktor + kotlinx.serialization (Dispatcharr, Xtream Codes, M3U, XMLTV)
- Hilt (DI), Coroutines + Flow (async), Navigation Compose (routing)
- Coil (image loading), Google Drive AppData (optional settings and progress sync)

## Requirements for Development

- Android Studio (latest stable)
- JDK 17 or newer (the JDK bundled with Android Studio works)
- Android SDK 36 (compile and target), minSdk 26 (Android 8.0)

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and build the debug app:

```
git clone https://github.com/jonzey231/AerioTV-Android.git
cd AerioTV-Android
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

Or open the project root in Android Studio and run the `app` configuration on a device or emulator.

Optional: Google Drive sync needs your own Google Cloud OAuth Web Client ID in `local.properties` as `GOOGLE_DRIVE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`. The app is fully functional without it; only Drive sync is disabled.

- Works on phones, tablets, and Google TV / Android TV

## Building for Release

- App bundle for Google Play: `./gradlew :app:bundleRelease` (requires a `keystore.properties` with your signing config; an absent keystore produces an unsigned release)
- Standalone APK: `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`
